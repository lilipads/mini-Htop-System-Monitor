# mini Htop System Monitor

In this toy project, I built a simplified version of htop that monitors memory and cpu usage for linux systems. 

The program interface looks like this:

The source of data comes from reading the linux system directories, such as /proc/meminfo, where it stores system level infomation.

## ncurses
[ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) is a library that facilitates text-based graphical output in the terminal. This project relies on ncurses for display output.

Within the Udacity Workspace, `.student_bashrc` automatically installs ncurses every time you launch the Workspace.

If you are not using the Workspace, install ncurses within your own Linux environment: `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

## Make
This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Usage Instruction
* Run the resulting executable: `./build/monitor`
